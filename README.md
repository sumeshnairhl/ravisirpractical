The task is about blog management which is given by my senior to learn Laravel.


User Register and log in the system using laravel authentication.
After user successful logged in, show the full page with already created blogs.
On the same page place one button to POST NEW BLOG.
Categories are predefined in a database table using a seeder.
One blog has multiple categories.
In blog list page show one filter using created_at table field (Using Datepicker Jquery).
IMPLEMENT FILTER WITHOUT REFRESH PAGE using AJAX
Good design and a data structure is appreciated
You're free to use any front-end framework.


Thanks a lot sir for the help
